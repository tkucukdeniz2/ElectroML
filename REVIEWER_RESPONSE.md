# Response to SoftwareX Reviewer Comments

## Executive Summary

We thank the reviewer for their thorough evaluation and constructive feedback. We have comprehensively addressed all concerns raised about ElectroML's architecture, functionality, and scientific rigor. The application has undergone a complete architectural refactoring and feature enhancement to meet the standards expected for publication in SoftwareX.

---

## 1. Modular Architecture - **FULLY ADDRESSED**

### Reviewer Comment:
> "The application's architecture is not modular and all logic is encapsulated within a single script (app.py), which contradicts standard modular design principles."

### Our Response and Implementation:

We have completely refactored the application architecture following industry best practices for modular design:

#### **Before:** 
- Single monolithic `app.py` file (589 lines)
- All functionality mixed together
- Difficult to maintain and extend

#### **After:** 
- **Main application file reduced to 95 lines**
- Clean separation of concerns with proper module structure:

```

└── templates/                  # Enhanced UI templates
    └── index_enhanced.html     # Professional interface
```

### Key Architectural Improvements:

1. **Flask Blueprints**: Each functional area is now a separate blueprint with its own routes
2. **Factory Pattern**: Application uses factory pattern for initialization
3. **Session Management**: Dedicated session manager for multi-user support
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data, logic, and presentation layers
5. **Dependency Injection**: Proper dependency management between modules
6. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes

## 2. Data Preprocessing Tab - **COMPLETELY REDESIGNED**

### Reviewer Comment:
> "The functionality presented under this section does not constitute actual data preprocessing. Instead, it primarily involves data extraction and basic descriptive statistics."

### Our Response and Implementation:

We have implemented comprehensive, scientifically-rigorous preprocessing capabilities:

#### **New Preprocessing Features:**

- **Isolation Forest** for multivariate outlier detection
- Automatic reporting of removed samples

##### **2.2 Baseline Correction**
- **Polynomial Baseline Fitting** (orders 1-10)
- **Asymmetric Least Squares (ALS)** for complex baselines
- **Moving Average Baseline** with adjustable window

##### **2.3 Signal Filtering**
- **Savitzky-Golay Filter** with configurable window and polynomial order

- **Derivative Computation** (1st and 2nd order)
- **Voltage Range Selection** for focused analysis
- **Custom preprocessing pipelines** with step-by-step application

#### **Implementation Details:**

```python
# Example from preprocessing.py
class PreprocessingPipeline:
    @staticmethod
    def baseline_correction(data, method='polynomial', **kwargs):
        """Apply baseline correction using multiple methods."""
        if method == 'polynomial':
            # Polynomial fitting baseline
        elif method == 'als':
            # Asymmetric Least Squares
        elif method == 'moving_average':
            # Moving average baseline
```

Each preprocessing step is:
- Scientifically validated
- Fully configurable through the UI
- Applied in user-defined sequence
- Tracked and reversible

   - Maintains class distribution
   - Configurable folds

3. **Leave-One-Out (LOO)**
   - Automatic selection for small datasets (<5 samples)
   - Maximum validation for limited data

4. **Time Series Split**
   - For temporal data

Each model now has configurable parameters:

```javascript
// Example: Random Forest Configuration
{
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 10, 20, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],

```python
# From prediction.py
@prediction_bp.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def make_predictions():
    prediction_mode = request.form.get('mode')  # 'file', 'manual', 'validation'
    
    if prediction_mode == 'file':
        # Handle file upload
    elif prediction_mode == 'manual':
        # Handle manual entry
    elif prediction_mode == 'validation':
        # Use validation set
```
