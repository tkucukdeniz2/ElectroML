This is the list of jobs to do to enhance the program, do them one-by-one:
1. add tooltips to training tab for the settings of ML algorithms.
2. add tooltips to the error metrics
3. after the training complete, show the predicted and actual values on a table and on a chart (scatter). also add any neccesary visual charting at this step.
4. I can't click the prediction link in the left side menu after training complete.
