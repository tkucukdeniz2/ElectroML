## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher (works with Python 3.13!)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tkucukdeniz2/ElectroML.git
cd ElectroML
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python run.py
```

The application will automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5000`

## 📊 Usage

### Workflow

1. **Upload Data**
   - Drag and drop your voltammetric data file
   - Supported formats: Excel (.xlsx, .xls) and CSV
   - Data format: First column = Concentration, remaining columns = Current measurements

2. **Extract Features**
   - Configure preprocessing options (smoothing, window length)
   - Automatic feature extraction and importance ranking
   - Visual feature importance analysis

3. **Train Models**
   - Select one or multiple ML algorithms
   - Optional hyperparameter optimization
   - Real-time training progress
   - Comprehensive performance metrics

4. **Make Predictions**
   - Upload new measurements
   - Select trained model
   - Get concentration predictions with confidence intervals
   - Export results for further analysis

### Example Data

A sample dataset (`src/sensor_data.xlsx`) is provided demonstrating the required format:
- Column 1: "Con" - Analyte concentration (μM)
- Columns 2+: Current measurements from -1V to +1V (0.005V increments)
